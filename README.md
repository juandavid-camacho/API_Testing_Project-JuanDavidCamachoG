# API Automation Final Project - Juan David Camacho G

### Initial Considerations
- This is the repo for the API Automation Final Project stated in the RestAssured Practice pdf document.
- All the 4 tests are in api_practice.feature in order for them to run back-to-back automatically.
- Every step is documented through a console output.
- Different classes were created for client and resource step definitions to make the code flexible and adaptable.
- For the Gherkin code, mostly is the same as the suggested steps but some little thing were tweaked.

> [!NOTE]
> This project was run using Java 21, you might need to change it.
